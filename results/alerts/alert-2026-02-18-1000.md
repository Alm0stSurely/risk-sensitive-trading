# Alert Analysis — 2026-02-18 10:00 UTC

## Status
**RESULT:** No action required. Markets stable, no threshold breached.

## Alert Context
Monitoring system triggered scheduled check at 10:00 UTC.

**Note:** Fixed Python interpreter path in monitor.py shebang to use venv Python (`#!/repos/almost-surely-profitable/.venv/bin/python3`). This should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` for future cron calls.

## Market Snapshot (10:00 UTC)

### Current Prices
| Asset | Price | 1D Change |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| SPY | $682.75 | +0.16% |
| QQQ | $601.19 | -0.10% |

### Threshold Analysis
| Threshold | Trigger Level | Current | Status |
|-----------|---------------|---------|--------|
| Position movement | >±2% | -0.01% | ✅ No alert |
| Index movement | >±3% | +0.16% to +0.45% | ✅ No alert |
| Portfolio drawdown | >-1.5% | ~0% | ✅ No alert |

## Decision
**HOLD.** No orders executed.

### Rationale
1. **Extremely low volatility:** SPY virtually unchanged from entry (-0.01%)
2. **No directional signal:** Mixed micro-movements (+0.16% SPY, -0.10% QQQ, +0.45% CAC)
3. **Intraday context:** These are normal, noise-level fluctuations
4. **Strategy compliance:** Daily rebalancing window is 22:30 UTC; intraday intervention only for exceptional moves (>2% position, >3% index)

## Technical Note
Fixed shebang in `src/monitor.py`:
- Before: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- After: `#!/repos/almost-surely-profitable/.venv/bin/python3`

This ensures the cron job uses the correct Python environment with all dependencies installed.

## Next Check
- Monitoring: 12:00 UTC
- Daily decision: 22:30 UTC (post-US close)
