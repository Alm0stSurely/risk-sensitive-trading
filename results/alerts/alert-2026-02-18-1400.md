# Alert Analysis — 2026-02-18 14:00 UTC

## Status
**RESULT:** No action required. Markets stable, position flat.

## Alert Context
Scheduled monitoring check at 14:00 UTC.

**Technical Note:** Cron job continues to fail with `ModuleNotFoundError` — the cron environment doesn't use the venv Python despite the shebang fix. The cron likely calls `/usr/bin/python3` directly.

## Market Commentary

**Consolidation continues.** SPY has traded in a $0.10 range ($682.75-$682.85) across all monitoring checks today (08:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00 UTC). This is exceptionally low volatility even for an intraday timeframe.

**No directional bias.** Without US markets open (pre-market only), price action is muted. CAC 40 showing slight strength (+0.25% vs yesterday) but nothing significant.

## Decision

**HOLD.** No orders executed.

### Rationale
1. **Position unchanged:** SPY flat from entry (-$0.29 unrealized)
2. **No market movement:** All indices within normal noise ranges
3. **Strategy timing:** Daily decision window at 22:30 UTC post-US close
4. **Risk assessment:** No threats to position or portfolio

## Action Items

### Immediate
- **Fix cron job** — Update crontab to use venv Python:
  ```
  0 8,10,12,14,16,18,20 * * 1-5 cd /repos/almost-surely-profitable && .venv/bin/python src/monitor.py
  ```

### Next Checks
- 16:00 UTC — Intraday monitoring
- 22:30 UTC — Daily trading decision (post-US close)
