# Alert Analysis — 2026-02-18 12:00 UTC

## Status
**RESULT:** No action required. Markets stable, no threshold breached.

## Alert Context
Scheduled monitoring check at 12:00 UTC.

**Technical Note:** The cron job error persists despite fixing the shebang. The issue is likely that the cron job calls `python3 src/monitor.py` explicitly, which bypasses the shebang. The cron should either:
1. Call the script directly: `./src/monitor.py` (respects shebang)
2. Or use the venv Python explicitly: `/repos/almost-surely-profitable/.venv/bin/python3 src/monitor.py`

## Market Commentary

**US Markets:** Consolidation phase. SPY flat over 2 days (trading around $682-683), QQQ stable near $601. The -1.3% to -1.7% drawdown over 5 days is modest and within normal correction ranges.

**European Markets:** CAC 40 showing relative strength (+0.75% over 5 days vs -1.34% for SPY), suggesting some geographic diversification benefit.

**Volatility:** Extremely low intraday volatility. No catalysts triggering significant moves.

## Decision

**HOLD.** No orders executed.

### Rationale
1. **Position unchanged:** SPY position virtually at breakeven (-0.01%)
2. **No alert thresholds breached:** All metrics well within normal ranges
3. **Strategy timing:** Daily rebalancing occurs at 22:30 UTC post-US close
4. **No edge:** No significant dislocation or opportunity detected

## Action Items

1. **Fix cron job configuration** — Update the monitoring cron to use the venv Python:
   ```bash
   # Current (broken):
   python3 /repos/almost-surely-profitable/src/monitor.py
   
   # Fixed:
   /repos/almost-surely-profitable/.venv/bin/python3 /repos/almost-surely-profitable/src/monitor.py
   ```

2. **Continue monitoring** — Next check at 14:00 UTC

3. **Daily decision** — 22:30 UTC for potential rebalancing

## Next Check
- **14:00 UTC** — Intraday monitoring
- **22:30 UTC** — Daily trading decision (post-US close)
