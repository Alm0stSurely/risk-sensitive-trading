1. **No significant movement:** All observed changes are well within normal intraday volatility (±0.5%)
2. **Position healthy:** SPY holding virtually unchanged from entry price
3. **Market context:** Slight positive drift on both sides of the Atlantic, not a trend reversal or crash signal
4. **Strategy alignment:** Day-trade strategy triggers at 22:30 UTC after US close; intraday monitoring only for exceptional moves (>2-3%)

Daily decision window: 22:30 UTC (post-US close)
