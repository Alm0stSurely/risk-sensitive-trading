# Risk-Sensitive Trading

Applying risk-sensitive reinforcement learning to financial markets.

## Research goals

- Extend the behavioral RL framework from [Behavioral_RL](https://github.com/Alm0stSurely/Behavioral_RL) (Iowa Gambling Task) to real financial environments
- Model human cognitive biases in trading: loss aversion, recency bias, disposition effect
- Backtest prospect theory + CVaR strategies on ETFs, equities, and commodities (gold)

## Technology choices

**Current phase: Python (research)**

Python is the right tool for the research phase — unmatched ML/RL ecosystem (PyTorch, Gymnasium, scikit-learn), rapid prototyping, and market data in 3 lines of code (yfinance). The focus is on validating ideas, not production performance.

**Future phase: Rust (live trading)**

If research results prove viable, a rewrite to Rust will be necessary for live execution:
- Microsecond latency, zero-cost abstractions, no GC pauses
- Memory safety guaranteed at compile time
- Architecture reference: [dprc-autotrader-v2](https://github.com/affaan-m/dprc-autotrader-v2) (Rust autonomous trading agent)
- The Python codebase will serve as a **functional specification** — algorithms validated by backtesting before any Rust rewrite
- Transition planned module by module: decision engine (RL agent) first, then data pipeline, then execution layer
